The airline reservation system was developed to make the tasks regarding air travel easy for both the users and the airline company. The users can book flights, cancel their booked flights, view the bookings made and update their user details whenever necessary. The airline company, on the other hand, will be able to add/ delete airplanes and flights, modify existing flight details, view bookings made and passenger lists for flight. The existing commercial airline company, IndiGoâ€™s reservation system was considered as a reference model for this project. The XAMPP open-source software was used in developing the project as it was a familiar working environment to the developers. Scripting languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP, frameworks such as bootstrap were used to develop the website and MySQL database was used for the data storage.
